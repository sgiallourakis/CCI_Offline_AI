# PWA Icons

Place your PWA icons here:

- icon-192.png (192x192 pixels)
- icon-512.png (512x512 pixels)

These icons are referenced in manifest.json and will appear:
- On the home screen when installed
- In the browser tab
- In the app switcher

You can generate icons from a single image using tools like:
- https://realfavicongenerator.net/
- https://www.pwabuilder.com/imageGenerator

For now, you can use any PNG image and rename it to icon-192.png and icon-512.png.
